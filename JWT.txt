Q2) Explain JWT in approx and prove its top 3 benefits. 

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a standard for creating and representing claims securely between two parties. 
It is typically used in web applications and APIs to authenticate users and transfer information between 
systems. 

JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header typically consists of the 
type of the token and the signing algorithm being used. The payload contains the claims, which are 
statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. The signature is used to verify that 
the sender of the JWT is who it claims to be and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the 
way. 

There are several benefits to using JWT: 

 Security: JWT uses a digital signature to verify the authenticity of the token and prevent 
tampering. This makes it more secure than storing sensitive information in a cookie or local 
storage on the client side. 

 Scalability: JWT can be easily passed between systems and is self-contained, meaning it contains 
all the necessary information about the user, eliminating the need to query a database on every 
request. This makes it easier to scale applications that use JWT. 

 Statelessness: Because JWT is self-contained, it doesn't require the server to store any session 
state. This makes it easier to scale horizontally and reduces the risk of server-side attacks such 
as cross-site request forgery (CSRF). 

Overall, JWT is a convenient and secure way to represent claims and transfer information between 
systems, particularly in the context of web applications and APIs.
